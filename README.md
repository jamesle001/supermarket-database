# supermarket-database
This project is a part of assessments on Database Design and Implementation from Nanyang Technological Univeristy, Singapore.

The database is designed and created to record retail sales and manage retail services for a supermarket with many branches. 
-	The database includes important information of employees, branches, customers, products, products purchased by customers, and products purchased from suppliers as well as suppliersâ€™ details.
-	The database includes forms to insert information of employees, customers, and suppliers.  
-	Reports are useful insightful information for the management such as best performing branch, top sale of product and top supplier for decision-making purposes. With that valuable information, management can improve and further develop strategy to drive sale and later successfully operate the supermarket. With the popularity of data analytics and prescriptive analytics, most company uses existing insights to supply and manage their business better. For example, with report of top spending customers, the supermarket can timely give customers rewards to increase the customer stickiness. Moreover, with performance of branches, supermarket can reward and pride employees and branches with good performance in order to keep morale at high level.

This project is the collaboration between James Le Ngoc Canh and Chia Ming Hui
